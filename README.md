# Simple-Insurance-Policy
This a simple group project using Python to display insurance policy using simple methods like Functions and Modules, but setting up verification processes using Loops.

Assignment Question:
"""
 We will model the basic functionality of an Insurance company such as Admiral (www.admiral.com). 
System description / requirements :
A user can create an Insurance Policy using your app. The user can enter the following policy details:
User’s name
Duration of Insurance Policy  in number of years
Policy type: Car insurance, Home insurance or Mobile phone insurance
Payment type: Bank transfer, PayPal or Credit card.

The base ‘premium’ of the policy (cost of the insurance policy) needs to be calculated and is based on the type and duration. 
Car Insurance = £500 per year.
Home Insurance = £1000 per year.
Mobile Phone Insurance = £10 per month.

There is a transaction fee that is added to the base premium based on the payment type:
Bank transfer = 0% (no fee)
PayPal = 10% of the base premium.
Credit Card = 20% of the base premium


Your Task:
Write a Python program that allows the user to enter all the policy details as mentioned.
Then calculate the total cost of the Insurance Policy for the entire duration of the policy. 
Print all the details of the Policy nicely along with the total cost calculated above.
Then, allow the user to enter a list of Insurance premiums (a series of float numbers). Neatly print the sum of these premiums, the value of the maximum premium entered and the average of all premiums entered.

Hints and tips:
You can write the whole program without using functions. But see if you can use a separate module(s) and re-usable functions within them to achieve the above tasks.
